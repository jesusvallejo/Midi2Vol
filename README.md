Windows Volume Control for Nano. Slider


This is mainly developed for Nano. Slider, but it can be fairly easily used with any Midi based potentiometer. 
It is written only for Windows and wont work on any other plataform as it has to be written in OS compatible language (C# in this case with .net framework).

The app lives in the tray in order to be less intrusive, for the moment the only options are to exit the app and to Add/remove the StartUp run.
On installation app will be added to StartUp run by default, if you don't want to run it each boot just remove it with the Add/remove button.

There are three versions,all three are the same but the icon, which can match your Nano. Slider's appearance, in the future there will be an option to configure it instead of multiple installers.

I'll provice a binary installer but i recommend you to compile it by yourself. 
It is provided as is, and it comes with no guarantee.(see LICENCE.md)

Nevertheless any change, update or upgrade is welcomed.

This project uses the following libraries:

- AudioSwitcher.AudioApi.CoreAudio : https://github.com/xenolightning/AudioSwitcher
- NAudio: https://github.com/naudio/NAudio
